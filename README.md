Youdyog is coming up with PublicFone.

- An anonymous speech based twitter, this accepts the audio and tags it 
  categorically(location, speakers qualification, topic),	based on the IVRs speech recognition system from ozonetel
- This speech data is fed to the review pipeline where moderators can listen to these speech comments,
	and grant the approvals along with qualifiers like positive,negative,neutral against each dataset
- The moderation workflow shall have moderators identified according to the category of the data,
	the moderators can be an expert or a passionate contributor to the field/category
	also look at the qualifications of the moderators for reviews against a topic/speech
- Moderators log in to find out the number of speech data available to be reviewed and go through it in an itemized way and enter their review comments
- The user can log in anonymously and see the voted topics, category-wise and reply on the speech already reviewed,
	this is possible only through another speech/voice message which will be fed to the moderation workflow 
- There are verified and non-verified users
	A non-verified user information can contain the Unique user-id, location, qualification, orientation, affiliations, passion however it shall not contain the name address etc of the users
	A verified user can keep their information with us but we will not expose their names to other users
	What is considered as an unique identifier is the phone number of the user which can be hashed and used to generate a unique id, to be more accurate we can use extra information like imei/macaddr to generate the specific hash
